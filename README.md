What‚Äôs the thing? Why do we need a Code of Conduct? We are all people with good intent only.
A Code of Conduct is the embodiment of a warm and open-hearted welcome to people from every background. It tells people that you are creating a safe space for everyone, regardless of their attributes. You need to say that invite loud and clear, otherwise it‚Äôs just words (or maybe not even that). And you have to take responsibility and enforce it if necessary. To make that possible, you have to tell people what they can rely on. 
Your Code of Conduct is your statement, publicly setting an expectation to yourself in regards of your inclusivity. With a Code of Conduct we are defining what we are setting as the lowest bar, and let people know how they can call us out if we as a community fail to achieve this. Your intent on inclusion may be the best in the world, but if you don‚Äôt make it public, how could someone hold you accountable to it?

Terminology
Incident is an event, happening or action that could be violating the Code of Conduct.
Moment is an overarching  initiative, campaign, project that we want to rally behind. [2]
Diversity‚ÄØis the‚ÄØfull range of human‚ÄØand/or‚ÄØorganizational differences‚ÄØand‚ÄØsimilarities e.g.,‚ÄØvalues,‚ÄØbeliefs, experiences,‚ÄØbackgrounds. [1]
Inclusion‚ÄØis the‚ÄØact‚ÄØof intentionally creating‚ÄØan‚ÄØengaging,‚ÄØrespectful, supportive, and‚ÄØempowering‚ÄØenvironment by engaging each other‚Äôs‚ÄØstrengths, experiences, and perspectives‚ÄØto achieve‚ÄØa‚ÄØcommon‚ÄØobjective. [1]

Creating Awareness
Before the Moment
Publishing the Code of Conduct is the first step in creating awareness for the topic of inclusion. Repeatedly pointing folks to the Code of Conduct during promotion of your event is a good idea as well. Let people know they can expect a safe space and you will reach folks that normally wouldn‚Äôt attend your event because they belong to a marginalized group or feel otherwise uncomfortable. 
During the Moment
Introducing and reminding your guests/your community of the Code of Conduct should be a prioritized talking point during welcoming. Also introduce the team and make clear that their efforts are solely to create a safe space for everyone.
The team should introduce themselves during events and at shift changing and let folks know about the Code of Conduct (re-paste Link)  and how to reach them. 
After the Moment
A reporting can be made available after the Moment to build trust and credibility. Being open about incidents helps other organizers to scope the work of putting a Code of Conduct team in place.
Reporting of Incidents
Giving people various opportunities to report an incident is among the most crucial tasks. Incident reporting should be as low-friction as possible, not adding up to the level of discomfort someone already experiences when talking about harassment. 
Provide multiple clear ways to report an incident, personally and anonymously:
-	in person (for physical events only)
-	email
-	Twitter DMs
-	phone
-	messenger on the platform (if this is happening on e.g. FB you provide contacts on their messenger)
-	neutral messengers (Signal, Telegram, etc)

Dealing with Incidents
Dealing with incidents is definitely the most difficult part of the job. There is not one way to handle all incidents, as incidents will differ a lot. But that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a team. If the incident appears tricky, consult the team and make the decision together.
Of utmost importance: The affected person has highest priority. Please make sure that their condition is taken care of. This is probably on you as a first-responder, but ask for help in the team.
Decide on severity
You may take action before logging the incident only if:
It‚Äôs a minor incident, that you have identified yourself. For example a thoughtless comment on the chat that you as a team member identified. 
As soon as there‚Äôs a third party involved, please log before you act.
Logging
When you log an incident, please provide
‚Ä¢	a screenshot (Capture that immediately. Before everything else. First of all, literally.), 
‚Ä¢	a list of people involved, 
‚Ä¢	a short description what happened, including time & platform, 
‚Ä¢	if the issue could be resolved and what you need from other folks on the team to do so. 
 
Incident Communication 
You are letting your team know the moment you log the incident. No matter what way the incident reached you, please take what you have and inform the team on the platform you agreed on (a private Teams channel for instance). Ask for help and tag people.
Consequences and Enforcement
That has also a wide range of options. Depending on the platform, you may or may not have the opportunity to act immediately.

YouTube Livestream
You may hide chat messages if you have been made a moderator for the channel. You may report the chat message and the user to the YouTube Platform team. 
YouTube is one of the more rough places for inappropriate behavior, but also a very active channel that guarantees activity on the chat.
Twitch
Is there a moderator role for Code of Conduct team members? Can I hide messages? Can I report chat messages without reporting the user? Can I ban users?
 
Twitter / Periscope
Periscope has limited moderation capabilities and you can only make use of them through the app. To provide the moderator role to someone, the two of you have to follow each other. Muting and blocking of users is possible then through the app only.

Teams Live Event
Teams Live Events provides moderated Q&A only. A member of the Code of Conduct team should be promoted to being a moderator on the Teams Live Event to look into content that might violate the Code of Conduct. An person external to the org owning the Live Event can‚Äôt be promoted to moderator. 
   
After you delete (not dismiss) a comment, it won‚Äôt show up anywhere anymore. Be sure to make screenshots first.
LearnTV (as soon as there is a chat)

TL;DR Find a solution with the affected person(s). If they can‚Äôt feel safe, you will expel the aggressor from the event.

The Team
Everyone on the team should take care of the team. Being part of a Code of Conduct team is emotional labor. Being involved in an incident is emotional labor. Please respect that your team will process their involvement differently. 
Team Setup
Your team should consist of at least three people or more depending on the projected workload. Why three? You should provide a minimum of diversity in the team itself, and that bare minimum is having a representation of your choice (e.g. person of color / person identifying as female / person identifying as member of the LGBTQI+ community / person with a disability). This will mostly be a matter of availability, to be honest. By the way, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with adding straight white abled mid-aged cis-men to the team. But only if they don‚Äôt take up the space of a member of a marginalized group. You will need to add them on top. As space (budget constraints, seats, licenses) may be limited, your first choice to drop someone from the team will be the person who‚Äôs adding the least diversity.  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ‚Äç 
Also I recommend having at least one member external to your company and making this transparent to everyone. Again, this is structure for reducing barriers. If I was to report on inappropriate behavior of your CxO, for sure I wouldn‚Äôt trust you. No matter how much empowerment you have from your CEO to approach them in case this happens, the reporting party will not know about this circumstance and probably pull back. Same applies to incidents with the organisers. 

Team Guidance
This question will come up: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs our job?‚Äù. Put together a guidance document in which you define the scope of work. This depends on the schedule, platform, type of event, number of attendees, number of sessions, distribution of audience and much more. 
A sample guidance can be found here and in the appendix.  
Internal Team Communication
As we are Microsoft, I recommend using Teams as internal communication platform. You can be assured we are meeting standards in regards to data safety. You‚Äôre going to discuss potentially super-sensitive topics in these chats. Make sure those protocols are stored in a safe place.
Here‚Äôs how we‚Äôve put it for Create: Frontend:
We‚Äôve created a private team in Teams and also invite external CoC team members here. This Teams team has two channels, one called General for discussions and socializing, and one for logging incidents. This ‚ÄúIncident Report‚Äù channel is also private, so we can have organisers or event owners in the General channel but not disclose any ongoing incident before we are clear on who is involved (might be organisers, staff, etc).
  

Team Introduction
The full Code of Conduct Team should be listed on the Code of Conduct page and introduced live during the opening session.
The full team should be introduced with names including their pronouns and the languages they are familiar with. This introduction should be covered on 
1)	the Code of Conduct page,
2)	the opening session,
3)	opportunities, where the Code of Conduct is referred to / link to the Code of Conduct is posted,
a.	Beginning of sessions
b.	Opening of social sessions (happy hour, networking)
c.	Breaks,
d.	Incidents.
Team Wellbeing
What applies to our community approach applies to your Code of Conduct team as well: Make it a warm and safe place. I recommend to also take care of each other. While this sounds natural, it might be unintentionally deprioritized in an incident situation. Make sure your team, especially the first-responders, have all they need from a mental care taking perspective.
Make it fun to be on the team, in a respectful way. 

Team Appreciation
Diversity & Inclusion and the Code of Conduct team is essential to the success of an event, be it online or in person. The team should be treated as such when it comes to appreciation. 
Make mentioning the Code of Conduct team in your reports a priority. Even if there has been nothing mentionable in their work (no incidents or only minor incidents), you should list the full team and give kudos the same way you give to speakers or co-organizers. But keep away from picking one person or one incident for representing the work of the team or giving an example. This might boomerang back to individual people (‚Äúthat person that gains their visibility through diversity topics‚Äù) or a negative connotation of your event‚Äôs success (‚Äúthe event where this XYZ thing happened, how awkward.‚Äù)

Retrospectives / Aftermath

Speaking of mental health, please make sure your team members are feeling well after a shift of duty, a day or a week later. Check in with them and see if they‚Äôre ok. Offer to chat with them if you get aware of any ripple effects.
Regarding developing our work with Diversity & Inclusion we never stop learning. This also applies to the state of this document. If you can afford the time, please hold retrospective sessions and edit this document with all learnings.

Team Communication
After the event you want to probably report back what has happened. Even if nothing happened, which is unlikely, to be honest.
