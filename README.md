## What's the thing? Why do we need a Code of Conduct? We are all people with good intent only.

A Code of Conduct is the embodiment of a warm and open-hearted welcome
to people from every background. It tells people that you are creating a
safe space for everyone, regardless of their attributes. You need to say
that invite loud and clear, otherwise it's just an empty discourse (or
maybe not even that). You, as an organization, are giving your word and
taking responsibility to lead in a positive direction for everyone your
Code of Conduct welcomes. To make that possible, you have to tell people
what they can rely on and you may need to enforce your words whenever
necessary.

Your Code of Conduct is your statement, publicly setting an expectation
to yourself in regards of your inclusivity, and everyone that attends
the space that you have created, be it a speaker, a contributor, a
sponsor, a partner, an organizer or a special or regular guest. With a
Code of Conduct you are setting the lowest bar you are willing to accept
regarding how people conduct themselves and treat others, and
encouraging yourself and the community to aim higher. Your intent on
inclusion may be the best in the world, but if you don't make it public,
how could someone hold you accountable to it? Or dare to ask anyone for
support?

101](https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq#coc101whatis).

## Terminology

**Diversity** is the full range of human and/or organizational
differences and similarities e.g., values, beliefs,
experiences, backgrounds.​ [\[1\]](#section-6)

**Incident** is an event, happening or action that could be violating
the Code of Conduct.

**Inclusion** is the act of intentionally
creating an engaging, respectful, supportive, and empowering environment
by engaging each other's strengths, experiences, and perspectives to
achieve a common objective.​ [\[1\]](#section-6)

**Moment** is a term that has been used in older versions of this document. It has been replaced by "initiative". [\[2\]](#sources)

## Choosing a Code of Conduct

There are numerous Code of Conducts published for all sorts of events.
Some have been created by diligent community members, some with the help
of lawyers, but the vast majority of them are copies and adaptions from
existing ones. While using a common template and adapt it to your needs
is the general recommendation, you will want to obey to some rules to
avoid pitfalls:

-   Stick to the license your template has been published under. If
    there's no license mentioned, don't use that Code of Conduct.

-   Safe licenses to copy and adapt the Code of Conduct probably are,
    depending on how you use and license the Code of Conduct yourself:
    [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), [CC
    BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/), [CC BY
    SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/)
    
-   Try to find an alignemnt with any Code of Conduct or Business Conduct (and core values) of the company you drive this initiative for, if any. 

-   Use a current version. A template from 2012 is most likely replaced by a better enforceable version.

-   tbd

## Creating Awareness

### Before the event is even layouted a.k.a Publish your Code of Conduct Early

Publishing the Code of Conduct is the first step in creating awareness
for the topic of inclusion. Repeatedly pointing folks to the Code of
Conduct during promotion of your event is a strong signal as well. Let
people know they can expect a safe space and you will reach folks that
wouldn't attend your event as they belong to a
marginalized group and expect to be forgotten, left out and skipped. There's many legit reasons why members of marginalized groups feel uncomfortable.

Also consider publishing an Etiquette [\[3\]](#sources) and an
Accessibility Statement [\[4\]](#sources).

### During the Happening

**Introducing and reminding your guests/your community of the Code of
Conduct should be a prioritized talking point during welcoming.** Also
introduce the team and make clear that their efforts are solely to
create a safe space for everyone.

**The team should introduce themselves during events and at shift
changing and let folks know about the Code of Conduct
(re-paste/show/present/highlight shortlink) and how to reach them.**

### After the Happening

A reporting can be made available after the Moment to build trust and
credibility in your community. Being open about incidents helps other
organizers to scope the work for their Code of Conduct team. 

## Reporting of Incidents

Giving people various opportunities to report an incident is among the
most crucial tasks. **Incident reporting should be as friction free as
possible**, not adding up to the level of discomfort someone already
experiences when talking about harassment.

**Provide multiple clear ways to report an incident, personally and
anonymously:**

-   **face to face (for physical events only)**

-   **email**

-   **Twitter DMs**

-   **phone**

-   **messenger on the platform (if this is happening on e.g. FB you
    provide contacts on their messenger)**

-   **neutral messengers (Signal, Telegram, etc)**


## Handling Incidents

Handling incidents is the toughest part of the job. There is not one way
to handle all incidents, as incidents will differ a lot. If the incident
appears tricky, consult the team and make the decision together.

**Of utmost importance: The affected person has highest priority. Please
make sure that their condition is taken care of. This is usually on
the first-responder, but that person can and should ask for help in the
team to ensure the affected person's needs are prioritized.**

### Decide on severity

You may take action **before** logging the incident only if it's a minor
incident, that you have identified yourself. For example a thoughtless
comment on the chat that you as a team member identified.

**As soon as there's another person involved, please log before you
act.**

### Logging

When you log an incident to the agreed logging platform, please provide

-   a **screenshot** (capture that immediately. Before everything else.
    First of all, literally.),

-   a **list** of **people** involved,

-   a short **description** of what happened, as factual as possible,
    including time & platform,

-   if the issue could be resolved and 

-   **what you need** from other folks on the team to find a resolution.

of what was going on and a list of names (spaced out in this screenshot
for privacy reasons). ](media/image1.tiff){width="6.5in"
height="3.9506944444444443in"}

When you log an incident, please remember

-   to stay calm and factual.

-   that this is not about you, what you experienced or who you are. It's
    easy to mix up emotions with facts in situations that are
    emotionally demanding. \<3

-   if you are targeted by a Code of Conduct violation, immediately
    involve another team member.

### Incident Communication 

You are letting your team know the moment you log the incident. No
matter how the incident reached you, please take what you have and
inform the team on the platform you agreed on (e.g. a private Teams
channel). **Ask for help and tag people.**

### Consequences and Enforcement

There\'s a wide range of options. Depending on the platform, you may or
may not have the opportunity to act immediately. You will find a varied
selection of platform examples and proposals on how to make use of these
mechanisms in the appendix section [Enforcement on Various
Platforms](#enforcement-on-various-platforms).

TL;DR **Find a solution with the affected person(s). If they can't feel
safe, you will expel the aggressor from the event.**


## The Team

Everyone on the team should be taking care of the team. Being part of a Code
of Conduct team is emotional labor. Being involved in an incident is
emotional labor. Please respect that your team will process their
involvement differently.

### Team Setup

**Your team should consist of at least three people or more depending on
the projected workload.** Why three? You should provide a minimum of
diversity in the team itself, and that bare minimum is having a
representation of your desired audience diversity (e.g. person of color / person identifying
as female / person identifying as member of the LGBTQI+ community /
person with a disability). This will mostly be a matter of availability,
to be honest. By the way, there's nothing wrong with adding straight
white abled mid-aged cis-men to the team. But only if they don't take up
the space of a member of a marginalized group. You will need to add them
on top. As space (budget constraints, seats, licenses) may be limited,
your first choice to drop someone from the team will be the person who's
adding the least diversity.

**Also I recommend having at least one member external to your company
and making this transparent to everyone.** Again, this is structure for
reducing barriers. If I was to report on inappropriate behavior of your
CEO, for sure I wouldn't trust you. No matter how much empowerment you
have from your CEO to approach them in case this happens, the reporting
party will not know about this circumstance and probably pull back. Same
applies to incidents with the organisers.

### Team Guidance

This question will come up: "What's our job?". Put together a guidance
document in which you define the scope of work. This depends on the
schedule, platform, type of event, number of attendees, number of
sessions, distribution of audience and much more.

A sample guidance can be found [here](link) and in the appendix.

### Internal Team Communication

For internal communication use a platform that you trust.You should feel safe in regards to data
safety and General Data Protection Rights (GDPR). You're going to discuss potentially highly sensitive topics in
these chats. Make sure those protocols are stored in a safe place.

One possible scenario:

We've created a private team in Teams and also invited the external CoC team
members. This Teams team has two channels, one called General for
discussions and socializing in the Code of COnduct enforcement team, and one for logging incidents. This
"Incident Report" channel is separated so we can have organisers or
event owners in the General channel but not disclose any ongoing
incident before we are clear on who is involved (might be organisers,
staff, etc).

### 

### Team Introduction

**The full Code of Conduct Team should be listed on the Code of Conduct
page and introduced live during the opening session.**

The full team should be introduced with names including their pronouns
and the languages they are familiar with. This introduction should be
covered on

1)  the Code of Conduct page,

2)  the opening session,

3)  opportunities, where the Code of Conduct is referred to / link to
    the Code of Conduct is posted,

    a.  Beginning of sessions

    b.  Opening of social sessions (happy hour, networking)

    c.  Breaks,

    d.  Incidents.

### Team Wellbeing

What applies to our community approach applies to your Code of Conduct enforcement
team as well: Make it a warm and safe place. I recommend to actively take
care of each other. While this sounds natural, it might be
unintentionally deprioritized in an incident situation. Make sure your
team, especially the first-responders, have all they need from a mental
care taking perspective.

Make it fun to be on the team, in a respectful way.

### Team Appreciation

Diversity & Inclusion and the Code of Conduct team is essential to the
success of an event, be it online or in person. The team should be
treated as such when it comes to appreciation.

Make mentioning the Code of Conduct team in your reports a priority.
Even if there has been nothing mentionable in their work (no incidents
or only minor incidents), you should list the full team and give kudos
the same way you give to speakers or co-organizers. BUT: keep away from
picking one person or one incident for representing the work of the team
or giving an example. This might boomerang back to individual people
*("that person that gains their visibility through diversity topics")*
or a negative connotation of your event's success *("the event where
this XYZ thing happened.")*

## 

## Retrospectives / Aftermath

Speaking of mental health, please make sure your team members are
feeling well after a shift of duty, a day or a week later. Check in with
them and see if they're ok. Offer to chat with them if you get aware of
any ripple effects.

Regarding developing our work with Diversity & Inclusion we never stop
learning. This also applies to the state of this document. If you can
afford the time, please hold retrospective sessions and make a Pull Request to this
document with all learnings.


## Impact

Having an enforced Code of Conduct has public and business impact.

Public impact includes a general perception of inclusiveness, culture of
caring and responsibility as well as an overall improved user
experience.

-   General perception of inclusiveness

    -   We're not leaving out anyone. 

    -   We're creating a safe space. Not for some, but for all.

-   Culture of caring

    -   We're not perfect but willing to improve. Fallibility is not a
        weakness, but a learning opportunity.

    -   We're dedicating time and space to listen to concerns.

    -   We're not expecting the worst, but are prepared to act in case.

    -   We understand that individual experience will differ.

-   Responsibility

    -   We're open to feedback and ready to improve.

    -   Our industry and humanity demands allyship. We're showing up.

    -   If anyone is threatening the safe space we created, we will take
        action.

-   User Experience

    -   The Code of Conduct team actively improves the user experience,
        as they report inaccessible or inappropriate elements, e.g. an
        online quiz that rewards attendees on a fast internet
        connection. This may happen before, during and after the initiative.

    -   The Code of Conduct team can be a consulting partner during the
        planning process and advise through their experience.


More points to prove (work in progress)
-   How having a CoC impacts publicly and
    privately the attendee experience.  Eg If the
    attendees notice CoC is being enforced and they talk about it, is
    there any data of attendees leaving or staying silent/less engaged
    when CoC is not enforced.

-   How having a CoC positively affects speakers, panel moderators, etc.
    Do they feel protected. What leading voices are more willing to
    deliver a talk or participate because they see the CoC is strong.

-   How having a CoC supports organizers, so they are encouraged to
    engage in future editions because they feel protected and the CoC
    contributes to offer a quality experience, which also impacts that
    event's identity.

### Team Communication

After the event you want to probably report back what has happened. Even
if nothing happened, which is unlikely, to be honest.

Example email link. 

TL;DR We had a friendly audience. Only few things to mention.
Recommendation is to  keep this level of investment into Code of Conduct
(CoC) work. We can still learn a
lot. ![🙂](media/image5.png){width="0.27847222222222223in"
height="0.27847222222222223in"}

 

Until now were 3 incidents that the team considered worth filing on our
internal channel. None of them got reported to the platform (YouTube,
dev.to) CoC teams. None of them was reported to us, but the CoC team
identified them as issues that should be filed and communicted to the
orga team. This was done today.

 

1.  The kahoot quiz was not inclusive to people on limited bandwidth.
    Lagging connections made it impossible for some to equally
    participate and have the same opportunity for winning a prize, that might be considered a monetary value e.g.
    to people searching for a job). We might want to reduce stress and
    provide more time or take out the \"monetary\" value.

2.  There was a group of people during the start of the workshop making
    fun of the trainers\' appearance. This is considered aggressive
    behaviour, and although this might seem like a joking behaviour of a
    few that might even have a personal connection to the trainers, it
    also sets a tone in the chat that others might pick up and dynamics
    can become unpredictable. Mitigation was to remind people of the
    Code of Conduct link it and ask them for contenance. This resolved
    the issue. 

3.  The workshop repo is using master as the main branch. The trainers
    used \"master\" (referring to the main branch) in their language
    while presenting. Nobody spoke up on this, but as this video stays
    online for a while, we recommend migrating the repo to use main
    instead of master and make a note of this in README.md. This also
    educates people on the current situation of unintentional racism in
    language. People who do the workshop later will se this issue
    mitigated.


Thanks for creating a wonderful event. And thanks to this "team
formidable" for their Code of Conduct duty. ❤
